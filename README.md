## Hello and welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ¤˜

Iâ€™m a developer passionate about understanding the web in its entirety â€” not only how to build interfaces, but also how things work behind the scenes. My goal is to deeply understand every layer that involves web development: from architecture, backend, APIs, databases, and infrastructure to performance, SEO, accessibility, and user experience. While I have strong frontend experience, Iâ€™m constantly evolving to become a complete developer â€” someone who understands the full cycle of modern web applications. Iâ€™m also interested in management, team organization, and technical leadership, aiming to combine technical excellence with efficient processes.

I currently work heavily within the VTEX ecosystem, building high-performance, scalable e-commerce solutions aimed at driving store growth, increasing conversion, and enhancing customer experience. My daily routine involves developing storefronts, landing pages, and headless commerce architectures with VTEX IO and FastStore to support business expansion and operational excellence.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology and the future itâ€™s building. Learning new things and embracing challenges keep me motivated.
