## Hello and welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ¤˜

I'm obsessed with the web and the future that technology is building, so working and discovering new technologies is extremely fun for me. I always like the feeling of learning new things and feeling challenged.

Iâ€™m a developer passionate about understanding the web in its entirety â€” not only how to build interfaces, but also how things work behind the scenes. My goal is to deeply understand every layer that involves web development: from architecture, backend, APIs, databases, and infrastructure to performance, SEO, accessibility, and user experience.

I currently work heavily within the **VTEX ecosystem**, building high-performance, scalable e-commerce solutions. My daily routine involves developing storefronts, landing pages, and headless commerce architectures with VTEX IO and FastStore. Beyond coding, I actively participate in architectural decisions, performance optimization, and improvements in scalability and maintainability.

While I have strong experience in front-end development, my constant pursuit is to become a complete developer â€” someone who understands the full cycle of building modern web applications. From designing robust backend services and managing databases to deploying, monitoring, and optimizing applications in production.

I enjoy solving complex problems, designing clean and scalable solutions, and continuously learning new technologies and concepts to evolve both technically and professionally.
